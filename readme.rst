Callgrind collect-openclose
===========================
overview
--------
Callgrind with a simple patch, add option ``--collect-openclose``.

``--collect-openclose`` is to counting Ir between first time opening testcase and last time closing output file.

It is used in online judge system, we use callgrind to measuring algorithm performance (use cpu instruction).

``--collect-openclose`` option can avoid to counting too much cost at VM initialization(ex. jvm), because it has nothing to do with algorithm performance.
